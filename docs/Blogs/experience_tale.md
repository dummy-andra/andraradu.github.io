### The motives I decided to shape as a tech explorer 

<br />
<br />


> My motivations for faring across tech world, handling new tools with ease  were as varied as the areas I reached. But a few motives stand out as being especially inspired by the Vikings'' exploring spirit. I always found their accomplishments as explorers and settlers equally magnificent.

#### Testing the Seas

<br />

The first land I explored and where I settled for 3 years was QA Engineering where I got involved in embedded, ai/mobile, OS and banking projects (check them bellow):

- `Embedded` field @Intel and @ENEA collaborating as a QA engineer on [Yocto Project – It's not an embedded Linux distribution – it creates a custom one for you](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)

- `AI` field @FotoNation  with a heavy focus on design, schedule and implement complex tests for imaging software products (functional, non-functional, structural, regression)

- `OS` field as a Linux QA Engineer @SuseLinux

- `Banking` field QA Engineer for Raiffeisen and BRD bank

#### Playing with the finger into the DevOps Ocean 

<br />


After testing the seas for a while I decided to sail into DevOps roles.

- `IOT waters`  swimming with RasberyPis @[Easypost](https://easypost.ro/) and @[DeviceHub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devicehub-net/about/)
- `Gaming shores` Pacman project @BandaiNamco
- `Docker` the Boat on Copernicus the European Union's Earth Observation Program 
- `Jumping into AWS with fashion` [@Localised](https://www.localised.com/)
- `First bite into Kubernetes @IBM`
- `The field  that I encountered but only lightly explored eSim @Ericson`

#### Comfortable in bigger winds and enjoying my time on the water.

<br />


In my sailing adventure I explored for ~2years the `Technical Escalation Support @Microsoft` working simultaneously with top 500 companies by provisioning, maintenance, providing Infrastructure support/advisory on Microsoft Azure Architecture and Services with a main focus on AKS, ACI, Azure Container Apps, Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO), this role required joggling with meetings, scoping, prioritizing troubleshooting, isolate the issue and deliver  solutions alongside mentoring my  team, help them with their tasks, authoring learning materials, being a proxy between product group-customers-engineers,  helping other teams. I once was told that our role is similar to a urgency medical stuff, the patients are arriving with serious wounds, we prioritize then, heal them, and move to the other batch of patients, each day non stop.

> This adventure polished me at the finest level of getting to acknowledge that I am capable to sail  WINDWARD (facing the wind ) also LEEWARD (facing away the wind)
