### The motives I decided to shape as a tech explorer 
<br />

> My motivations for faring across tech world, handling new tools with ease  were as varied as the areas I reached. But a few motives stand out as being especially inspired by the Vikings'' exploring spirit. I always found their accomplishments as explorers and settlers equally magnificent.

#### Testing the Seas

The first land I explored and where I settled for 3 years was QA Engineering where I got involved in embedded, ai/mobile, OS and banking projects (check them bellow):

- `Embedded` field @Intel and @ENEA collaborating as a QA engineer on [Yocto Project â€“ It's not an embedded Linux distribution â€“ it creates a custom one for you](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)

- `AI` field @FotoNation  with a heavy focus on design, schedule and implement complex tests for imaging software products (functional, non-functional, structural, regression)

- `OS` field as a Linux QA Engineer @SuseLinux

- `Banking` field QA Engineer for Raiffeisen and BRD bank

#### Playing with the finger into the DevOps Ocean 

After testing the seas for a while I decided to sail into DevOps roles.

`IOT`  
- @[Easypost](https://easypost.ro/) <- offers delivery solutions in automatic terminals [lockers]
   -  The lockers core is a RasberyPi which is runned by a custom-made Debian Image
      -  I designed and implemented a bash script which included 2 main stages:
          -  build a vanila OS based on Linux packages
          -  customize the image accordingly to the bussiness needs in matter of app/networking/security/monitoring
      -  Designed Pipelines to launch a new image creation when app code was modified
      -  Set up monitoring and logging with ELK, Logstash, FileBeat and Sensu | Graphite and Grafana/Influxdb
      -  Using SaltStack for infrastructure management


-@[DeviceHub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devicehub-net/about/) <- think of it as Wordpress for IoT applications
   - DeviceHub is a distributed computing platform that allows to develop, debug, scale and evolve Internet of Things (IoT) applications 
      -  I implemented server infrastructure orchestration with Salt
      -  Worked with LCX and building custom Debian packages

<br/>

- `Gaming` <- Pacman project @BandaiNamco
   - Short Ramp-UP tasks on Ansible, AWS
<br/>

- `Containers and container Orchestartion` <- Copernicus the European Union's Earth Observation Program  @eaudeweb
   - working with Docker, Dockerfiles, DockerCompose on a daily basis
   - container workestration done via Rancher
<br/>

- `Cloud` [@Localised](https://www.localised.com/) <- ecommerce localisation for the worldâ€™s most coveted brands
   - working with AWS services on a daily basis,
   - Creating scripts for AWS Lambda with Python and Boto3, in order to collect the logs at a granular level and create Cloudwatch dashboards
   - Infrastucture management via CloudFormation
   
 <br/>

#### Comfortable in bigger winds and enjoying my time on the water.

I explored for ~2years the `Technical Escalation Support @Microsoft` working simultaneously with top 500 companies by `provisioning: maintenance, Infrastructure support/advisory on Microsoft Azure Architecture and Services with a main focus on AKS, ACI, Azure Container Apps, Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO)`, this role required joggling with meetings, scoping, prioritizing troubleshooting, isolate the issue and deliver  solutions alongside mentoring my  team, help them with their tasks, authoring learning materials, being a proxy between product group-customers-engineers,  helping other teams. I once was told that our role is similar to a urgency medical stuff, the patients are arriving with serious wounds, we prioritize then, heal them, and move to the other batch of patients, each day non stop.

ðŸ˜±ðŸ’£ðŸ¤¯ **My career path shaped me**:
- ðŸš€ to be capable of `resolving complex issues`, `learn on the spot`, `adapt`, `filter the log noise and find the patterns`
- ðŸš€ `not to be own by the tools I use` <- having a clear view that first we need to understand what the issue is or what the needs and expectation are and then look for the suitable tools
- ðŸš€ how to talk with customers [customer service skills ]  
- ðŸ¤¯ and many more
