I started as QA Engineering where I got involved in embedded, ai/mobile, OS and banking projects (check them bellow):

- `Embedded` field @Intel and @ENEA collaborating as a QA engineer on [Yocto Project – It's not an embedded Linux distribution – it creates a custom one for you](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)

- `AI` field @FotoNation  with a heavy focus on design, schedule and implement complex tests for imaging software products (functional, non-functional, structural, regression)

- `OS` field as a Linux QA Engineer @SuseLinux

- `Banking` field QA Engineer for Raiffeisen and BRD bank

#### I was looking to get different problems  that evolve constantly, every day.

 <br/>

I become more interested in solving complex business problems  and building solutions and environments that impact others success, not only my own team.

I satisfied my desire activating as a `Technical Escalation Support` [@Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), by interacting with internal teams and with customer engineering teams on a wide variety of `Azure projects (migration, containerization, transformation)` in different time zones meeting SLAs and ensuring 24×7 support for:
  - `Azure environment troubleshooting and setup`, configuring and maintaining backup, monitoring, and alerting systems, writing infrastructure as code (Azure Resource Manager, Biceps), advisory on Microsoft Azure Architecture and Services, with a main focus on `AKS, ACI, Azure Container Apps, Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO)`.

This role required joggling with meetings, scoping, prioritizing troubleshooting, isolate the issue and deliver  solutions alongside mentoring my  team, help them with their tasks, authoring learning materials, being a proxy between product group-customers-engineers,  helping other teams.
